Note ID: 661621, Text: A 56-year-old male was admitted to the ICU after elective operation for a thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysm and intra-operative hemorrhage. On the 24th day of ICU stay the patient was re-operated for infection of the thoracotomy with pus collection, which required drainage. On the 52nd day PDR Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated from bronchial secretions. He had already received 31 days of colistin treatment, combined with ampicillin/sulbactam (for 22 days) and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole (for 8 days), all given for treatment of polymicrobial pneumonia caused by MDR strains of Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae and bacteremia by MDR Klebsiella pneumoniae strain. By the time of isolation of the PDR microorganism the patient's condition was steadily deteriorating; eventually irreversible septic shock and multiple organ failure led to his death on the 68th day of ICU stay.
Note ID: 671748, Text: A 35-year-old male was transferred to our hospital from another medical center with infection of the lower respiratory tract and UTI due to COS Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The patient had a history of rupture of an aneurysm of the circle of Willis that was surgically managed. During his prolonged hospitalization, episodes of obstructive hydrocephalus and CNS infection complicated his clinical condition, which necessitated admission to the ICU. On the 32nd day of ICU stay, PDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from a urine specimen. By that time, he had received several combinations of antimicrobial agents, including 6 days of treatment with colistin, for lower respiratory tract infection with COS Pseudomonas aeruginosa. After isolation of the PDR pathogen he received combination treatment with colistin and ceftazidime leading to clinical cure of the UTI. The clinical condition of the patient gradually improved and he became afebrile. However, the patient's respiratory tract remained constantly colonized with MDR and COS Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. He was transferred to the neurosurgical ward after 134 days of ICU stay, in improved condition. Thirty days later, pneumonia relapsed and progressed into septic shock and multiple organ failure, and subsequent death.
